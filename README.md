# Tesla Stock Price Prediction Project

### Overview

This project aims to predict the stock price of Tesla using historical data and machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built using Python and various data science libraries to forecast Tesla's stock price based on past trends and market indicators.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes historical Tesla stock price data, obtained from Yahoo Finance API. It consists of 7 features, including date, opening price, closing price, high and low prices, trading volume and adjusted closing price. 

### Model Training

The following machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their predictive performance, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
Their performance is then analysed to have an understadning of how the different models work.
